## Redux

In this project, I have chosen not to use Redux as it would be unnecessary due to the size and complexity of the application.
Instead of using Redux, I have opted for simpler state management solutions such as React's built-in useState hook.These solutions provide a lightweight and efficient way of managing state within the application without the added overhead of Redux.
Overall, the decision to not use Redux in this project was based on the application's needs and the desire to keep the codebase lightweight and easy to manage.

## Courses data

I have reverse the list to show last 10 courses according to the requirements and implemented pagination using the 'slice' method to retrieve 10 courses. I resorted to this approach since the URL parameter did not provide the necessary data.
`В стрічці з курсами необхідно відобразити "останні" 10 курсів.`
