## Redux

In this project, I have chosen not to use Redux as it would be unnecessary due to the size and complexity of the application.
Instead of using Redux, I have opted for simpler state management solutions such as React's built-in useState hook.These solutions provide a lightweight and efficient way of managing state within the application without the added overhead of Redux.
Overall, the decision to not use Redux in this project was based on the application's needs and the desire to keep the codebase lightweight and easy to manage.
